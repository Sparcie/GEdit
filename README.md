# GEdit

GEdit is a tool for editing the graphics assets for my MS-DOS Games. Starting off this is mostly for Bob's fury, but I will be using it to create artwork for new games that I intend on building.

## Features

This tool will be able to edit indivual images, graphics packs (multiple images) and colour palettes.
The repo also include the old packer tool (which packs many images into one file) and the CGA and EGA conversion tools.

The file formats it supports are specific to the graphics libraries I've made for DOS.

## Hardware support

I'm only planning for VGA support for the tool, but you will be able generate images for other graphics modes.

- added page up/down and basic editing functions for the package editor
- added an information screen for the package editor
- fixed some of the paging mechanism (again) seems to work now

Some testing of the package editor and it should be done
Need to do palette editor and create help system.

- added the pgsedit to the main program.
- implemented saving and loading packages - I made it possible to select the file extension as the same format files
   have in practise a few different extensions. maybe I should make this consistent in future (pgs for all of them)
- debugged some of the display and cursor movement code
- found a stack overflow in imagesPerPage - it was accidentally recursive - fixed.

- moved exit menu to common ui as I'll use that menu for the other functions.
- started work on the graphics package editor - still need to implement functions such as load/save and editing functions.

- added a display of the currently used tool
- added continuous mode for both pixels and lines. Makes some drawing a little easier.

next job will be to create an editor for the graphics pack files (pgs) or palette.

- fixed pick size function to show x and y sizes
- fixed running out of memory when adding a new undo entry to the buffer - we remove the oldest when low on memory.
- put size limits on functions (such as rotate etc) where room in the back buffer is needed
- fixed behaviour of import/export when file selector is cancelled.
- reworked recursiveFill as it would stack overflow - had to come up with something that would use less stack space.
- created imageInfo to provide basic size information about the image and information about memory and the undo buffer.
- load the starting image into the undo buffer.
- fixed circle drawing where circle may hit edge of the screen.

Made significant progress - initial testing of image editor.
- extended the undo buffer.
- made some more interface functions on imgedit.pas so the external code can run it, save and load images and clear undo buffer.
- fixed some problems with the commonui functions.
- made the basics of the main program, only having the image editor so far.

There are still some issues with the user interface that need addressing and some drawing functions such as mirror and double are broken. also the circle function in VGA seems to not function correctly. The other editors still need to be built.

Began work on the main loop for the image editor. created the basics of the loop and an exit menu to confirm whether the user wants to quit and if they want to save the image.

Still needs some more work before I can do any testing.

I've re-written the pick size routine to allow for rectangular sizes
and have added a circle function to the image editor.

Still some way to go!

More work on the image editor
- changed max size to 200x200 (will need to make it possible to make rectangular sized images)
- added export to GFX, recursiveFill and randomFill functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've added some new functions to the common ui unit for a simple menu and help display.

This should be all the common ui elements needed now, so I should be able to work on the image editor and the pack editor.

Started work on the image editor portion of the gedit program.
- made an undo buffer 10 items long and procedures to add to it and undo one layer.
- made some basic functions such as double size, mirror and rotate. more to come.
- made a palette to make colour selection a bit easier if you re-use any.
- still need to make the main loop for doing the editing.

removed a TPU file from the repo, other than graph.tpu these should not be in the repo.

Initial commit - contains relevant source and binary files for begining development of a better graphical editor for my packed graphics files.
These files come from the Bobsfury reposity at rev 194, but will be modified for this new project.

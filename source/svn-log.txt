Began work on the main loop for the image editor. created the basics of the loop and an exit menu to confirm whether the user wants to quit and if they want to save the image.

Still needs some more work before I can do any testing.

I've re-written the pick size routine to allow for rectangular sizes
and have added a circle function to the image editor.

Still some way to go!

I've added some new functions to the common ui unit for a simple menu and help display.

This should be all the common ui elements needed now, so I should be able to work on the image editor and the pack editor.

Started work on the image editor portion of the gedit program.
- made an undo buffer 10 items long and procedures to add to it and undo one layer.
- made some basic functions such as double size, mirror and rotate. more to come.
- made a palette to make colour selection a bit easier if you re-use any.
- still need to make the main loop for doing the editing.

removed a TPU file from the repo, other than graph.tpu these should not be in the repo.
